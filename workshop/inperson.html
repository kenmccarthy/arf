            <span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 1rem">(120 minutes)</span>
          </h2>
          <p>
            The session is structured in seven stages, alternating between brief
            facilitator input and individual, paired, or small-group activity.
            Input segments should not exceed seven minutes each — prioritise
            activity time over presentation.
          </p>

          <div class="principle-card">
            <h3><span class="principle-number">1</span> Opening Provocation</h3>
            <p><strong>0–10 minutes</strong></p>
            <p>
              Open with interactive voting on three statements about AI and
              assessment. Display each statement in turn and ask participants to
              indicate agreement using a show of hands, sticky dots, or a
              polling tool. Statements should be genuinely provocative — not
              designed for consensus.
            </p>
            <p>
              After voting, invite brief discussion on the most divided
              statement. Use this to frame the session's central question:
              should the response to GenAI be about catching students out, or
              about redesigning the assessment itself?
            </p>
            <p>
              Close the provocation by signalling the shift the session will
              make: from detection to structural redesign.

              Deliver a brief mini-input (no more than seven minutes) on three
              connected ideas:

              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Learning outcomes</strong> — is the assessment aligned
                with what students need to demonstrate?

              <li>
                <strong>Making thinking visible</strong> — what structural

            <p>
              Follow immediately with a paired activity. Participants work in
              pairs to audit one of their own assessments against two questions:

                <strong>Paired activity prompt:</strong><br />
                1. What is this assessment actually asking students to
                demonstrate? Is that still the right thing to measure?<br />
                2. Where in this assessment could a student submit work that
                does not reflect their own thinking — and what structural
                feature enables that?
              </p>

            <p>
              Create a physical risk spectrum in the room using a long sheet of
              paper or tape on the floor labelled High, Medium, and Low. Ask
              participants to place a card or sticky note representing their
              assessment somewhere on the spectrum.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once all assessments are placed, facilitate a brief whole-group
              discussion. The aim is not to settle on definitive risk
              classifications, but to surface the structural features that place
              assessments at different points on the spectrum.
            </p>

                <strong>Facilitator guidance:</strong> Draw attention to the
                difference between risk of detection failure (which detection
                tools cannot reliably address) and structural mitigation (which
                redesign can address). Shift the conversation from policing to
                design.

              Participants return to their seats with a clearer understanding of

            <p>
              This is the heart of the workshop. Participants work individually

            <p>
              The canvas has six fields. Participants should complete each in

              After completing the canvas individually (approximately twenty
              minutes), participants share their redesign with one other person
              for peer critique using the three prompts below.
            </p>

            <h4 id="peer-critique">Peer Critique Prompts</h4>
            <p>
              Each participant receives feedback from their partner using these
              three questions only:
            </p>

            <div class="principle-card">

              <p>
                Does the redesigned assessment contain at least one feature that
                makes the student's reasoning, decision-making, or learning
                process evident — something that AI alone cannot produce?

                If a student submitted the output of an AI system with minimal
                human intervention, would it still meet the assessment criteria?
                If yes, what structural change would close that gap?

              </h3>
              <p>
                Does the redesign add meaningful value without creating
                disproportionate marking burden? If the cohort is large, are
                there completion-based, sampled, or peer-supported elements that

                appropriate balance, or are all assessments clustered in one

              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Consistency:</strong> Are AI use expectations consistent
                and legible across modules, or are students encountering
                conflicting rules?

                <strong>Collaboration:</strong> Which redesign decisions can be
                made at module level, and which require programme or
                institutional agreement?

                significant variation in how colleagues approach AI — resist the

                commitment to discussing programme alignment, not immediate
                consensus.

            <h3>
              <span class="principle-number">7</span> Commitment and Close
            </h3>
            <p><strong>115–120 minutes</strong></p>
            <p>
              Each participant completes the following two prompts on an index
              card or in a shared document:
            </p>
            <div class="callout callout-success">
              <p>
                <em
                  >"The one structural change I will implement in my assessment
                  this semester is&hellip;"</em
                ><br /><br />
                <em>"The colleague I will discuss this with is&hellip;"</em>
              </p>
            </div>
            <p>
              The second prompt — naming a colleague — transforms a private
              intention into a social commitment. Read two or three aloud before
              closing. Collect the cards or keep the shared document accessible
              for follow-up.

          <h2>Engagement Strategies</h2>
          <p>
            In-person workshops have different energy dynamics from online
            sessions. The following strategies help sustain focus and
            participation across the full two hours.
          </p>

          <div class="callout callout-info">
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong
                  >Alternate between individual, paired, and whole-group work
                  every 15–20 minutes</strong
                >
                — sustained individual work in a room full of colleagues quickly
                loses energy; build in regular transition points
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Use physical movement during risk mapping</strong> —
                getting participants out of their seats in the first hour resets
                energy and creates a memorable shared reference point for later
                discussion
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Keep input segments under 7 minutes</strong> — this is a
                workshop, not a lecture; every input segment should lead
                directly into an activity
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Use visible timers</strong> — display a countdown timer
                on screen during breakout and canvas activities; this maintains
                pace without constant verbal reminders
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Prioritise redesign time over theory</strong> — if time
                pressure forces a choice, protect the Redesign Sprint (Stage 5);
                this is where participants produce something concrete to take
                away
