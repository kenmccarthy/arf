      <h2>The Two-Track Approach</h2>
      <span class="section-time">3 min read</span>
    </div>

    <p>Here&rsquo;s a key insight from the framework: you don&rsquo;t have to choose between &lsquo;all AI&rsquo; and &lsquo;no AI.&rsquo; Instead, think about a two-track approach where your programme includes both secured (AI-restricted) and open (AI-integrated) assessments.</p>

    <h3>Track 1: Secured / AI-Restricted</h3>

    <p>These are assessments where students must demonstrate knowledge or capability independently, without AI support. Examples:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>In-person exams (no resources, supervised)</li>
      <li>Clinical skills demonstrations (real-time, observed)</li>
      <li>Foundational knowledge assessments (verifying core concepts students must know)</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Why Track 1 matters:</strong> Some capabilities truly must be demonstrated without AI. A surgeon needs to know human anatomy independently. A teacher needs to understand pedagogical theories without a search engine. Not everything can be outsourced to AI.</p>

    <h3>Track 2: Open / AI-Integrated</h3>

    <p>These are assessments where students are encouraged to use AI ethically and critically, reflecting authentic professional practice. Examples:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Analysis and critique of AI outputs (students use AI, then evaluate what it got right/wrong)</li>
      <li>Complex problem-solving in realistic contexts (students might use AI as a thinking partner)</li>
      <li>Projects that mirror real-world work (where professionals actually use AI tools)</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Why Track 2 matters:</strong> In most fields, the future workplace will involve AI. Students need to learn how to use it responsibly, critically, and ethically. An assessment where students apply AI tools and reflect on the results develops genuine capability.</p>

    <p><strong>The balance:</strong> A coherent programme includes both tracks. Some high-stakes assessments are Track 1 (secure the foundational knowledge). Other assessments are Track 2 (develop AI fluency). Students experience a learning progression where they first master core material, then learn to apply AI thoughtfully.</p>

    <p>This isn&rsquo;t either/or. It&rsquo;s both/and.</p>

    <p>Whether you&rsquo;re designing Track 1 or Track 2 assessments, the framework suggests five practical strategies that make learning visible and make shortcuts much harder:</p>

        <h4>Authentic Problems</h4>
        <p>Design tasks around genuine challenges, not artificial scenarios.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h3>1. Multi-Stage Tasks</h3>

    <p>Instead of one submission, break the work into stages. For example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Week 5:</strong> Submit a proposal or plan (shows initial thinking)</li>
      <li><strong>Week 8:</strong> Submit an annotated draft or progress report (shows refinement)</li>
      <li><strong>Week 10:</strong> Submit final work + reflection on how thinking changed</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> You can see the evolution of learning. It&rsquo;s much harder to pretend understanding if you had to show your thinking at multiple points.</p>

    <h3>2. Oral Components</h3>

    <p>Add presentations, vivas, Q&amp;A sessions, or discussions. For example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>10-minute presentation of key findings (shows understanding)</li>
      <li>15-minute defence where you answer challenging questions (can&rsquo;t fake it if you don&rsquo;t understand)</li>
      <li>Seminar discussion where students explain and critique each other&rsquo;s work</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Real-time human interaction. AI can&rsquo;t show up to defend ideas. You learn a lot about understanding from how students respond to tough questions.</p>

    <h3>3. Reflective Elements</h3>

    <p>Ask students to think aloud about their process. For example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>&lsquo;What was your thinking when you made this choice?&rsquo;</li>
      <li>&lsquo;What feedback surprised you? How did it change your approach?&rsquo;</li>
      <li>&lsquo;If you used AI, where did you use it and why? What limitations did you notice?&rsquo;</li>
      <li>&lsquo;What would you do differently if you had more time?&rsquo;</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Reflection reveals understanding. A student who can&rsquo;t articulate their reasoning probably hasn&rsquo;t done it themselves. Also signals: &lsquo;I care about your thinking process, not just your final answer.&rsquo;</p>

    <h3>4. Collaborative Work</h3>

    <p>Include group projects with clear individual accountability. For example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Group project with peer evaluations of individual contributions</li>
      <li>Collaborative problem-solving where each person&rsquo;s role is documented</li>
      <li>Peer feedback sessions where students comment on each other&rsquo;s work</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Collaboration is harder to fake. When people actually work together, you see negotiation, disagreement, synthesis. Plus, collaboration mirrors real-world professional practice.</p>

    <h3>5. Authentic, Real-World Problems</h3>

    <p>Design tasks around genuine challenges, not artificial scenarios. For example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Real client projects (non-profit needing marketing strategy)</li>
      <li>Current events analysis (applying concepts to what&rsquo;s happening now)</li>
      <li>Community partnerships (students solving problems that matter to local stakeholders)</li>
      <li>Discipline-specific professional scenarios (what would a real engineer/nurse/architect actually do?)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Real-world problems have constraints and complexities that resist template answers. They require contextual judgement. They&rsquo;re harder for AI to pattern-match because the situation is novel and specific.</p>

      <div class="section-number">3</div>
      <h2>These Strategies Work Together</h2>
      <span class="section-time">1.5 min read</span>
    </div>

    <p>Here&rsquo;s the thing: these aren&rsquo;t isolated tricks. They work best together.</p>

    <div class="example-flow">
      <h4>Engineering Design Project</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Multi-stage task:</strong> Proposal (week 3) &rarr; Design sketches (week 6) &rarr; Final report (week 10)</li>
        <li><strong>Oral component:</strong> Presentation + Q&amp;A defending design decisions</li>
        <li><strong>Reflective element:</strong> Written reflection on trade-offs: &lsquo;Why this material? Why this shape? What would you change?&rsquo;</li>
        <li><strong>Collaborative work:</strong> Group project with individual accountability through peer evaluation</li>
        <li><strong>Authentic problem:</strong> Real building or product design, not a hypothetical scenario</li>
      </ul>
      <p>By the time a student submits this, you have multiple forms of evidence of genuine understanding. That&rsquo;s much more robust than a single essay.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="example-flow">
      <h4>Literature Seminar</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Multi-stage:</strong> Reading notes (week 2) &rarr; Close reading draft (week 6) &rarr; Final essay (week 10)</li>
        <li><strong>Oral:</strong> Seminar discussion where students defend interpretations</li>
        <li><strong>Reflective:</strong> &lsquo;How did the class discussion change your reading?&rsquo;</li>
        <li><strong>Collaborative:</strong> Peer feedback on drafts</li>
        <li><strong>Authentic:</strong> Analysing current texts and their cultural impact, not just canonical works</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Again, multiple forms of evidence. Learning is visible.</p>
    </div>


    <!-- Section 4: What About Class Size? -->
    <div class="section-header">
      <div class="section-number">4</div>
      <h2>What About Class Size?</h2>
      <span class="section-time">1.5 min read</span>
    </div>

    <p>I can hear you thinking: &lsquo;That sounds great, but I have 150 students in my class. How do I add all this?&rsquo;</p>

    <p>The framework directly addresses this. You don&rsquo;t have to mark everything the same way.</p>

    <p><strong>For early stages</strong> (multi-stage tasks):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Pass/fail marking instead of detailed criteria</li>
      <li>Checklists (&lsquo;Did they submit? Is it clear?&rsquo;) instead of rubrics</li>
      <li>Sampling: grade a subset, spot-check others</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>For collaborative work:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Peer feedback does some of the evaluation work (students assess each other)</li>
      <li>Structured peer evaluation forms can be quick to complete</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>For oral components:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Group presentations (5 students at a time) instead of individual vivas</li>
      <li>Class discussion instead of individual Q&amp;A</li>
      <li>Student recordings (video submission of explanation) instead of live oral</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>For reflective elements:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Structured prompts (&lsquo;In 100 words, explain one key decision&rsquo;) instead of open essays</li>
      <li>Rubric focused on presence of reflection, not depth (easier to assess at scale)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The point: You don&rsquo;t redesign everything simultaneously. Start with your highest-risk assessments. Start with strategies that feel most manageable for your context. Iterate.</p>

            <p>You can see the evolution of learning. It&rsquo;s much harder to fake understanding if you have to show your thinking at every stage.</p>

            <h4>Discipline examples</h4>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Engineering:</strong> Problem statement (week 2) &rarr; Design draft (week 5) &rarr; Final report (week 8)</li>

              <li><strong>Chemistry:</strong> Lab report + viva explaining methodology and results</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Marking tips</h4>
            <p>Group presentations reduce workload. Class discussion can be structured so it&rsquo;s not one-on-one.</p>

              <h4>Reflective Elements</h4>
              <p>Ask students to think aloud about their process and reasoning.</p>
            </div>
            <span class="strategy-exp-toggle">+</span>
          </div>
          <div class="strategy-exp-body">
            <h4>What it looks like</h4>
            <p>Structured reflection prompts, process journals, or brief written explanations of key decisions.</p>

            <h4>Why it works</h4>
            <p>Reflection reveals understanding and metacognition. A student who can&rsquo;t articulate their reasoning probably hasn&rsquo;t done it themselves. It also signals: &lsquo;I care about your thinking process, not just your final answer.&rsquo;</p>

            <h4>Discipline examples</h4>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Psychology:</strong> &lsquo;Explain how your literature review shaped your research question&rsquo;</li>
              <li><strong>Visual Arts:</strong> &lsquo;Describe three decisions you made in this design and why&rsquo;</li>
              <li><strong>Philosophy:</strong> &lsquo;How did the seminar discussion change your argument from draft to final?&rsquo;</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Marking tips</h4>
            <p>Use structured prompts (not open essays). Keep these relatively brief.</p>

            <p class="size-note"><strong>Very manageable at scale.</strong> Structured prompts are quick to assess.</p>

              <h4>Collaborative Work</h4>
              <p>Include group projects with mechanisms for recognising individual contributions.</p>
            </div>
            <span class="strategy-exp-toggle">+</span>
          </div>
          <div class="strategy-exp-body">
            <h4>What it looks like</h4>
            <p>Different collaboration models: group projects with peer evaluation, collaborative problem-solving with documented roles, or peer feedback sessions.</p>

            <h4>Why it works</h4>
            <p>Collaboration is authentic and harder to fake. When people actually work together, you see negotiation, disagreement, synthesis. Plus, collaboration mirrors real-world professional practice.</p>

            <h4>Discipline examples</h4>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Business:</strong> Group marketing campaign with individual contribution statements + peer evaluation</li>
              <li><strong>Engineering:</strong> Team design project with role documentation + individual reflection</li>
              <li><strong>Education:</strong> Collaborative lesson plan with peer feedback on each person&rsquo;s section</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Marking tips</h4>
            <p>Use peer evaluation forms to share the assessment workload. Structured contributions reduce fairness concerns.</p>

            <p class="size-note"><strong>Scales well.</strong> Peer evaluation reduces staff marking.</p>

              <h4>Authentic Real-World Problems</h4>
              <p>Design tasks around genuine challenges, not artificial scenarios.</p>

            <span class="strategy-exp-toggle">+</span>

          <div class="strategy-exp-body">
            <h4>What it looks like</h4>
            <p>Different authentic contexts: real client briefs, current events analysis, community partnerships, or discipline-specific professional scenarios.</p>

            <h4>Why it works</h4>
            <p>Real-world problems have constraints and complexities that resist template answers. They require contextual judgement. They&rsquo;re harder for AI to pattern-match because the situation is novel and specific.</p>

            <h4>Discipline examples</h4>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Marketing:</strong> Real client brief from local non-profit (not hypothetical case study)</li>
              <li><strong>Social Work:</strong> Community partnership project addressing actual local needs</li>
              <li><strong>Engineering:</strong> Design that solves a real problem (water access, energy efficiency, etc.)</li>
              <li><strong>Teaching:</strong> Develop resources for actual learners/classes, not imaginary ones</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Marking tips</h4>
            <p>Rubrics should assess application of knowledge to real constraints, not generic criteria.</p>

            <p class="size-note"><strong>Can be done at scale</strong> if you have multiple real projects/clients.</p>

          <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> A lecturer teaches a large second-year course (100 students) on British history. Currently, assessment is one 2,500-word essay due at the end of term. The lecturer wants to maintain this core assessment but is concerned about AI-generated submissions.</p>
        </div>

        <p class="kc-question">The lecturer is considering three approaches. Which most closely aligns with the framework we&rsquo;ve discussed, and why?</p>

            <div class="option-letter">A</div>

            <div class="option-letter">B</div>
            <p>Redesign as a Track 1 (secured) assessment with multi-stage tasks: proposal (week 4) &rarr; annotated draft (week 7) &rarr; final essay (week 10). Keep it individual work, no AI.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="option-card" data-option="C" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="Select option C">
            <div class="option-letter">C</div>
            <p>Redesign as a Track 2 (integrated) assessment where students use AI to find sources, but must reflect critically on what AI recommended vs. what actual scholars say.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p style="font-size: 0.9rem; color: var(--color-text-muted); margin-bottom: 0;">Select an option to see feedback. None is &lsquo;perfect&rsquo; &mdash; this is about applying what you&rsquo;ve learned.</p>

        <!-- Feedback Cards -->
        <div class="feedback-card neutral" data-for="A">
          <h4>Approach A: Discursive Control</h4>
          <p>You may have selected this because it&rsquo;s familiar (detection and rules). But remember Module 1? This is discursive control &mdash; rules students remain free to ignore, plus detection tools aren&rsquo;t reliable. The framework would say this doesn&rsquo;t redesign the task itself.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="feedback-card neutral" data-for="B">
          <h4>Approach B: Track 1 Redesign</h4>
          <p>This aligns well with the framework. You&rsquo;ve kept the assessment (essay) but added structural elements (multi-stage tasks) that make learning visible. You&rsquo;re building integrity into the task itself, not relying on rules or detection. This is a strong Track 1 redesign.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="feedback-card neutral" data-for="C">
          <h4>Approach C: Track 2 Redesign</h4>
          <p>This is also aligned with the framework &mdash; you&rsquo;re just making a different choice about which track. Track 2 suggests AI-integrated assessment where students develop critical evaluation skills. This would work well if your learning outcome includes &lsquo;critically engage with AI tools.&rsquo; The key is that you&rsquo;re clear about what you&rsquo;re assessing and why AI is part of the task.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Closing Note -->
        <div class="reflection-box closing-note" style="display: none;">
          <strong>Note:</strong> Both B and C are framework-aligned. The choice depends on your learning outcome. What capability do students need? That&rsquo;s what should drive your design.
