            <section id="introduction">
                <h2>Introduction</h2>

                <p>Since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022 and the subsequent surge in Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) technology, the education sector has been impacted significantly, with efforts to develop policies, strategies, and guidelines to support staff and students in navigating the changing landscape.</p>

                <p>While these technologies offer great potential for enhancing learning experiences, they also pose significant challenges to academic integrity. <strong>Traditional assessment methods—such as essays, unsupervised open-book exams, and online quizzes—are increasingly vulnerable</strong>, as students can access AI tools to produce content that appears to be original but is not their own work.</p>

                <div class="callout-box highlight">
                    <h4>The Core Problem</h4>
                    <p>Although AI detection tools have emerged, their reliability remains limited, and they cannot serve as definitive evidence of academic misconduct.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>The Shift from Detection to Prevention</h3>
                <p>The focus therefore shifts from <strong>detection to prevention</strong>, or as Cath Ellis espouses, from <strong>detecting cheating to detecting learning</strong>.</p>

                <p>This presents an urgent need for higher education institutions to reconsider their assessment strategies to uphold academic standards and ensure that assessments accurately reflect students' knowledge and skills.</p>

                <div class="callout-box">
                    <strong>Core Principle:</strong> Assessment must be redesigned <em>structurally</em>, not simply policed through detection.
                </div>

                <p>This framework supports educators in redesigning assessments to ensure they remain valid, fair, transparent, and aligned with learning outcomes in an AI-enhanced educational landscape.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="policy-context">
                <h2>The Evolving Policy Context</h2>

                <p>Assessment redesign is not solely a pedagogical issue but also a governance, quality, and ethical responsibility. National and international bodies now emphasise that assessment practices must remain robust in AI-enhanced environments.</p>

                <h3>Key Policy Developments</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>National guidance</strong> encouraging AI literacy, transparency, and equitable access</li>
                    <li><strong>UNESCO's Recommendation on the Ethics of AI</strong>, which emphasises human oversight, inclusion, and accountability</li>
                    <li><strong>The evolving EU AI Act</strong>, which highlights education as a high-impact context requiring transparency and risk mitigation</li>
                    <li><strong>Institutional policies</strong> increasingly requiring assessment strategies that address AI in learning and academic integrity</li>
                </ul>

                <p>These developments reinforce the central argument of this framework: <strong>assessment must be redesigned structurally, not simply policed through detection</strong>.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="objectives">
                <h2>Objectives</h2>

                <p>The goal of assessment redesign in an AI-enhanced context is to develop <strong>robust, fair, valid, and educationally meaningful approaches</strong> that ensure students can demonstrate genuine learning, understanding, and capability.</p>

                <p>Rather than focusing solely on preventing misuse of AI tools, assessment should be designed to <strong>make learning visible</strong> and to reflect how knowledge and skills are applied in authentic contexts.</p>

                <h3>Key Objectives</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Incorporate a diverse range of assessment types</li>
                    <li>Balance formative and summative approaches</li>
                    <li>Thoughtfully distribute high- and low-stakes tasks</li>
                    <li>Place greater emphasis on process, reasoning, and development over time</li>
                    <li>Support deeper learning and reduce reliance on single, product-focused submissions</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Addressing Challenges</h3>
                <p>In practice, redesigning assessment presents challenges, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Time constraints</li>
                    <li>Large class sizes</li>
                    <li>Evolving institutional expectations</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Nonetheless, <strong>careful consideration of where and how Gen AI use aligns with educational purpose is essential</strong>. Some assessments may appropriately integrate AI to develop student AI literacy and future-ready skills, while others may require independent demonstration of foundational knowledge or professional competence.</p>

                <div class="callout-box key-concept">
                    <strong>Central Guiding Principle:</strong> The alignment of assessment with programme and module learning outcomes. Assessment decisions—including format, level of supervision, and expectations around AI use—should be driven by what learners are expected to know, understand, and be able to do.
                </div>
            </section>

            <section id="scope">
                <h2>Scope</h2>

                <p>This framework supports educators and programme teams in rethinking assessment design in the context of Gen AI. It focuses on ensuring that assessment remains valid, fair, and aligned with learning outcomes while also supporting the development of responsible and effective AI engagement.</p>

                <h3>What This Framework Helps You Do</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Consider the purpose of each assessment</strong> and determine whether Gen AI use supports or undermines the intended learning outcomes, and how expectations should be clearly communicated to learners</li>
                    <li><strong>Identify assessment types</strong> that may be particularly vulnerable to inappropriate AI use and prioritise these for structural redesign rather than relying solely on detection</li>
                    <li><strong>Explore assessment approaches</strong> in collaboration with discipline-area colleagues, sharing strategies to strengthen authenticity, visibility of learning processes, and alignment with professional practice</li>
                    <li><strong>Meaningfully integrate Gen AI into assessment</strong>, supporting the development of student AI literacy and future-ready competencies</li>
                    <li><strong>Ensure coherence across modules and stages</strong>, contributing to a balanced programme-level assessment strategy that includes both AI-restricted and AI-integrated tasks</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>What This Framework Does Not Do</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Prescribe a single solution</li>
                    <li>Require banning AI tools</li>
                    <li>Focus primarily on detection</li>
                    <li>Offer quick fixes</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Rather, it <strong>offers principles and strategies that can be adapted to disciplinary contexts, institutional policies, and evolving technological and regulatory environments</strong>.</p>

                <h2>Reconsidering the Purpose of Assessment</h2>

                <p>In an AI-enhanced environment, reconsidering the purpose of assessment becomes imperative to foster a more meaningful and authentic learning experience.</p>

                <h3>Traditional vs. Authentic Assessment</h3>

                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h4>Redesigned Assessment</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Prioritises higher-order thinking</li>
                            <li>Analysis, evaluation, synthesis, creation</li>
                            <li>Shows learning processes</li>
                            <li>Real-world application</li>

                    </div>
                </div>

                <h3>Higher-Order Thinking Skills (Bloom's Taxonomy)</h3>
                <p>By prioritising these competencies, assessments can better reflect real-world applications and prepare students for the complexities of the modern workforce:</p>

                <p>This shift also encourages deeper engagement with the material, promoting a learning environment where students are evaluated not just on <strong>what they know</strong>, but on <strong>how they think and adapt</strong>.</p>

                <h3>Authentic Assessment in AI Context</h3>
                <p>It is important to acknowledge that even authentic assessments carry some risk of AI misuse. For example:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Written reflections, diaries, reports:</strong> Higher risk of AI assistance</li>
                    <li><strong>Interactive oral assessments:</strong> Lower risk of inappropriate AI use</li>
                    <li><strong>Multi-stage assessments:</strong> Greater visibility of process reduces outsourcing risk</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The redefined purpose of assessment should aim to <strong>cultivate lifelong learners equipped with the skills to navigate and innovate in an AI-driven world</strong>.</p>
