        <h2 class="mt-0">Risk Assessment</h2>
        <p>Assessments that involve the creation of an artefact as the main or only task typically pose a higher level of risk. Similarly, assessments that have little oversight such as unsupervised online assessments also pose a high level of risk. At the opposite end of the scale are fully supervised or proctored exams which have a lower risk level, however this approach can impact on authentic assessment design and contribute to an environment of mistrust rather than a culture of integrity depending on the context and use.</p>

          <p>In addition to the mitigation steps above, a variety of assessment media such as journals, e-portfolios, vlogs or blogs can be selected to accompany larger pieces of work or as stand-alone assessments.

      <!-- AI Detection -->
      <section id="ai-detection">
        <h2>AI Detection: Limits, Risks, and Appropriate Use</h2>
        <p>A range of AI detection tools have been developed in response to the increasing availability of GenAI. However, current evidence indicates that these tools produce both false positives and false negatives and cannot reliably determine authorship or intent. As a result, they are not suitable for use as primary or definitive evidence of academic misconduct.</p>
        <p>There are also significant equity and fairness concerns associated with AI detection. Research suggests that such tools may disproportionately affect multilingual writers and students whose writing does not align with dominant linguistic norms.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Appropriate Use of Detection Tools -->
      <section id="appropriate-use">
        <h2>Appropriate Use of Detection Tools</h2>
        <p>Within this framework, AI detection tools are understood as having, at most, a limited and contextual role.</p>
        <div class="callout callout-success">
          <h4>They may be used as:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Conversation starters to prompt discussion with students</li>
            <li>One indicator among many when reviewing assessment submissions</li>
            <li>A means of supporting educational dialogue rather than enforcing punitive measures</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="callout callout-important">
          <h4>They should not be used as:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Sole or decisive evidence in academic misconduct cases</li>
            <li>A substitute for robust assessment design</li>
            <li>A proxy for evaluating learning or understanding</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>Effective academic integrity practice in an AI-enhanced environment depends primarily on structural assessment redesign. Assessments that make learning processes visible — through staged tasks, reflective elements, oral components, and evidence of decision-making — reduce reliance on detection technologies and strengthen the validity of assessment judgements.</p>

      <!-- Postgraduate Programmes -->
      <section id="postgraduate">
        <h2>Postgraduate Programmes</h2>
        <p>While postgraduate work is often more closely supervised, the above may be adapted and applied where appropriate.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Oral examinations and presentations with Q&amp;A sessions can be increased throughout pinch points in the research journey</li>
          <li>The requirement of a reflective journal documenting the thought process is valuable both from a learning perspective and to support integrity</li>
          <li>Active learning such as collaboration with peers through group project work can lower the risk of AI misuse</li>
          <li>Working with industry for problem solving and co-creating is a robust approach</li>
          <li>Facilitating a workshop on GenAI and research at an early stage could contribute towards creating a culture of transparency and integrity</li>
          <li>Implications require more time investment particularly for large cohorts; needs consideration in resourcing</li>
