                <h2>Principle 1: Validity</h2>

                <p><strong>Validity</strong> means ensuring that assessment tasks genuinely measure the knowledge, skills, and competencies they are intended to assess, even in contexts where AI tools are widely available.</p>

                <h3>What This Means</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Assessment tasks accurately reflect the intended learning outcome</li>
                    <li>The task cannot be compromised or completed through inappropriate use of AI</li>
                    <li>The evidence gathered genuinely demonstrates student capability</li>
                    <li>The assessment remains rigorous and meaningful</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>How to Apply It</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Critically examine whether your current assessment can be outsourced to AI</li>
                    <li>If yes, redesign to make learning process visible (drafts, explanations, oral components)</li>
                    <li>Align assessment methods with disciplinary standards and professional requirements</li>
                    <li>Use varied assessment formats to capture different types of learning</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section id="fairness">
                <h2>Principle 2: Fairness and Equity</h2>

                <p><strong>Fairness and equity</strong> means recognising differences in access to technology, levels of AI literacy, language background, and learning needs, and designing assessment that does not disadvantage particular groups of students.</p>

                <h3>Key Equity Considerations</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Access to AI tools:</strong> Not all students have equal access to quality AI tools or data plans</li>
                    <li><strong>AI literacy:</strong> Students come from different educational backgrounds with varying AI familiarity</li>
                    <li><strong>Language background:</strong> EAL students may find written reflections or oral presentations differently challenging</li>
                    <li><strong>Neurodiversity:</strong> Timed or synchronous components may disadvantage some learners</li>
                    <li><strong>Disability:</strong> Physical or sensory disabilities require accessible materials and alternatives</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>How to Apply It</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Avoid assessment designs that privilege those with better access to technology</li>
                    <li>Offer multiple formats for demonstrating the same learning outcome</li>
                    <li>Build flexibility into deadlines and submission methods where possible</li>
                    <li>Explicitly teach assessment formats rather than assuming students know them</li>
                    <li>Regularly review assessment outcomes disaggregated by student demographic</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="callout-box">
                    <strong>Key Point:</strong> Good assessment design for students with disabilities or different backgrounds is good assessment design for all students.

            </section>

            <section id="transparency">
                <h2>Principle 3: Transparency</h2>

                <p><strong>Transparency</strong> means clearly communicating expectations around the purpose of assessment, criteria for success, and the extent to which AI use is permitted or restricted.</p>

                <h3>What This Includes</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Clear assessment briefs:</strong> Students understand what the task is asking and why</li>
                    <li><strong>Explicit criteria:</strong> Rubrics or grading standards are visible in advance</li>
                    <li><strong>AI use expectations:</strong> Whether AI is forbidden, permitted, or encouraged—and why</li>
                    <li><strong>Feedback mechanisms:</strong> How and when students will receive feedback</li>
                    <li><strong>Academic integrity policies:</strong> What constitutes appropriate and inappropriate practice</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>How to Apply It</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Provide detailed assessment briefs with learning outcomes explicitly stated</li>
                    <li>Explain the educational purpose: "This assessment requires independent work because..."</li>
                    <li>Use consistent language about AI use across modules in your programme</li>
                    <li>Provide examples of strong work so students can visualise expectations</li>
                    <li>Hold Q&A sessions early in the assessment period to clarify expectations</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section id="accessibility">
                <h2>Principle 4: Accessibility and Inclusion</h2>

                <p><strong>Accessibility and inclusion</strong> means aligning assessment design with Universal Design for Learning (UDL) principles and offering diverse ways for students to demonstrate their learning.</p>

                <h3>UDL in Assessment</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Multiple means of representation:</strong> Provide information in various formats (text, video, visual, audio)</li>
                    <li><strong>Multiple means of expression:</strong> Allow students to demonstrate learning through different formats (essay, presentation, portfolio, dialogue)</li>
                    <li><strong>Multiple means of engagement:</strong> Connect assessment to student interests and values where possible</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Practical Examples</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Offer choice of essay, presentation, or digital portfolio for the same outcome</li>
                    <li>Provide transcripts for video or audio content</li>
                    <li>Allow use of assistive technology (text-to-speech, speech-to-text)</li>
                    <li>Build in time flexibility rather than rigid deadlines</li>
                    <li>Clearly explain assessment expectations rather than assuming prior knowledge</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>How to Apply It</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Review assessment designs with accessibility in mind</li>
                    <li>Consult with disability services early</li>
                    <li>Ensure materials are in accessible formats (large print, digital, etc.)</li>
                    <li>Make accommodation a base design feature, not an add-on</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section id="alignment">
                <h2>Principle 5: Alignment with Learning Outcomes</h2>

                <p><strong>Alignment with learning outcomes</strong> means ensuring that decisions about assessment format, level of supervision, and AI use are driven by what students are expected to know, understand, and be able to do.</p>

                <h3>What This Means</h3>
                <p>Every assessment decision should answer: <strong>"Does this assessment genuinely measure the intended learning outcome?"</strong></p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Choose assessment formats that best measure the specific outcome</li>
                    <li>Avoid "traditional" assessment just because it's familiar</li>
                    <li>Match the level of supervision to what's being assessed</li>
                    <li>Consider whether AI use supports or undermines the outcome</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Example Decision Tree</h3>
                <div class="callout-box">
                    <p><strong>Learning Outcome:</strong> Students can demonstrate independent understanding of clinical assessment procedures.</p>
                    <p><strong>Question:</strong> Can this be done via essay with AI permitted? <em>Probably not.</em></p>
                    <p><strong>Better approach:</strong> Supervised clinical simulation or oral defence of clinical reasoning.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="callout-box">
                    <p><strong>Learning Outcome:</strong> Students can critically evaluate AI outputs and identify limitations.</p>
                    <p><strong>Question:</strong> Should students use AI? <em>Yes—it's the point of the assessment.</em></p>
                    <p><strong>Approach:</strong> Analyse AI-generated content, document findings, explain why outputs are/aren't trustworthy.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>How to Apply It</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Start assessment design from learning outcomes, not assessment formats</li>
                    <li>Ask: "What's the best way to verify students can do this?"</li>
                    <li>Align format, supervision level, and AI permissions to the outcome</li>
                    <li>Discuss with colleagues: Is this outcome best assessed individually or collaboratively? Orally or written? Supervised or open?</li>

            <section id="ai-literacy">
                <h2>AI Literacy: Core Development Outcome</h2>

                <p>Assessment redesign and AI literacy are <strong>intrinsically linked</strong>. As Gen AI becomes embedded in learning, work, and everyday life, students need more than technical familiarity with tools — they need the capacity to engage with AI <strong>critically, ethically, and effectively</strong>.</p>

                <p>Assessment plays a key role not only in measuring disciplinary knowledge but in <strong>developing students' ability to navigate AI-saturated environments responsibly</strong>.</p>

                <h3>What AI Literacy Includes</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Critical evaluation:</strong> Recognising inaccuracies, bias, hallucinations, and limitations in AI outputs</li>
                    <li><strong>Contextual judgment:</strong> Understanding how and when AI can be appropriately used, and when independent thinking or professional judgement is required</li>
                    <li><strong>Ethical use:</strong> Using AI transparently, disclosing use, respecting academic integrity and data privacy</li>
                    <li><strong>Integration as support:</strong> Using AI for thinking, problem-solving, and creativity—not as a substitute for learning</li>
                    <li><strong>Human-AI understanding:</strong> Recognising the role of the human in learning, judgment, and ethical oversight</li>
                    <li><strong>Influence awareness:</strong> Understanding how AI shapes thinking, behaviour, and decision-making</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>At Programme Level</h3>
                <p>Teams should determine:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Where AI literacy is an <strong>explicit learning outcome</strong></li>
                    <li>Where AI literacy <strong>contributes to broader attributes</strong> (critical thinking, digital competence, ethical awareness)</li>
                    <li>Where <strong>independent knowledge or professional standards must be demonstrated</strong> without AI support</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="callout-box key-concept">
                    <strong>Central Point:</strong> Assessment redesign is not only about preventing misuse—it's about educating students to become informed, critical, and responsible participants in an AI-enhanced world.
