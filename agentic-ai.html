      <!-- Overview -->
      <section id="overview">
        <h2 class="mt-0">Overview</h2>
        <p>Recent developments in GenAI point towards increasingly agentic systems — AI tools that can plan, act, iterate, and make decisions across multiple steps with limited human input. Unlike earlier generative tools that respond to discrete prompts, agentic AI systems can autonomously break tasks into sub-goals, retrieve and synthesise information, generate outputs, revise those outputs, and execute workflows on a user's behalf.</p>
        <p>These developments raise new considerations for assessment design. As AI systems become more capable of managing extended cognitive processes, the boundary between assisted work and outsourced thinking becomes increasingly blurred.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Emerging Challenges -->
      <section id="challenges">
        <h2>Emerging Challenges</h2>
        <p>Agentic AI introduces a number of challenges that extend beyond those associated with earlier generative tools:</p>

        <div class="callout callout-warning">
          <p>Diminished visibility of student thinking — where planning, decision-making, and iteration are performed by the AI rather than the learner</p>
        </div>
        <div class="callout callout-warning">
          <p>Further erosion of traditional authorship assumptions — particularly in assessments that involve extended projects, research, or problem-solving workflows</p>
        </div>
        <div class="callout callout-warning">
          <p>Increased difficulty distinguishing contribution — where students may oversee or curate AI-driven processes without engaging meaningfully with the underlying learning</p>
        </div>
        <div class="callout callout-warning">
          <p>Acceleration of task completion — potentially undermining assessment designs that rely on time, effort, or procedural complexity as proxies for learning</p>
        </div>

        <p>These challenges reinforce the limitations of detection-based approaches and highlight the need for assessment designs that prioritise human judgement, intentionality, and reflection.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Assessment Design Responses -->
      <section id="design-responses">
        <h2>Assessment Design Responses</h2>
        <p>Rather than attempting to prohibit or police agentic AI use, effective mitigation lies in structural assessment redesign that clarifies where human learning must be demonstrated.</p>

        <div class="numbered-list">
          <div class="numbered-card">
            <h3>Emphasising Human Decision-Making and Justification</h3>
            <p>Assessment tasks should require students to explain, justify, and critique decisions made throughout the learning process, including decisions about whether and how AI tools were used. This shifts assessment from output generation to evaluation, judgement, and accountability.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="numbered-card">
            <h3>Designing for Process Transparency</h3>
            <p>Multi-stage, process-oriented assessments — including planning documents, annotated drafts, reflective commentaries, and oral explanations — make it more difficult for agentic systems to fully substitute for student engagement.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="numbered-card">
            <h3>Integrating Critical Reflection on AI Agency</h3>
            <p>Where AI tools are permitted, assessments can explicitly ask students to reflect on: What tasks were delegated to AI; What limitations or errors were identified; Where human judgement overrode AI-generated suggestions.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="numbered-card">
            <h3>Prioritising Tasks Requiring Situated Human Context</h3>
            <p>Assessments that draw on lived experience, disciplinary interpretation, ethical reasoning, professional judgement, or contextual constraints remain less amenable to full automation.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="numbered-card">
            <h3>Maintaining Deliberate AI-Restricted Assessment Spaces</h3>
            <p>As agentic capabilities increase, it becomes increasingly important to retain some assessment contexts where independent human performance is required — to verify foundational knowledge, disciplinary understanding, and professional competence without AI mediation.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- Implications for AI Literacy -->
      <section id="ai-literacy-implications">
        <h2>Implications for AI Literacy</h2>
        <p>The emergence of agentic AI reinforces the need to broaden definitions of AI literacy. Beyond evaluating outputs, students must also learn to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Recognise when AI systems are assuming decision-making roles</li>
          <li>Understand the risks of cognitive offloading and over-reliance</li>
          <li>Reflect on responsibility, agency, and authorship in AI-mediated work</li>
          <li>Appreciate the continued value of human judgement, creativity, and ethical reasoning</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="callout callout-important">
          <p>Assessment therefore plays a crucial role in helping students develop discernment, not just technical proficiency.</p>
        </div>

      <!-- Looking Ahead -->
      <section id="looking-ahead">
        <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
        <p>Agentic AI represents a further shift in the educational landscape, but it does not invalidate the principles of good assessment. On the contrary, it reinforces the importance of validity, transparency, process visibility, and alignment with learning outcomes.</p>
        <p>By designing assessments that make human thinking explicit, require reflection on AI use, and prioritise judgement over generation, educators can respond proactively to emerging AI capabilities while maintaining academic standards and educational purpose.</p>
